Getting Started with MetaRelate
********************************

MetaRelate is a project to relate definitions within metadata schemes: it provides guidance on how to interpret a metadata definition from one scheme within another.

Getting started using the information requires the installation of some software.

The project is hosted on `Github, at MetaRelate <https://github.com/metarelate>`_

The primary tool is the Metarelate API, a programmatic interface to the knowledge management software.  The project also provides an editing interface, which can be used locally for managing information.

The API and editor is a Github repository, `MetaRelate <https://github.com/metarelate/metarelate>`_. 

Translation knowledge is held in separate projects.  

The Meteorology and Oceanography translation knowledge base is available: http://www.metarelate.net/metOcean/

The metarelate projects use Python, Django, Jena and Fuseki to provide the capabilities to manage a repository of translation information, an application programming interface and a user interface.

Live Knowledgebase
==================

There is a live knowledgebase for meteorology and oceanography metadata mappings, hosted at `here <http://www.metarelate.net/metOcean/>`_

There is a contributor work flow on this site, enabling submission of simple new and updated mappings to the knowledgebase.

Use
===

The metarelate API provides programmatic access to the data in the local triple store.  This API enables valid and relevant information to be retrieved and converted to a form which can be used by other applications.

Translation Retrieval
---------------------

The metarelate :class:`metarelate.fuseki.FusekiServer` provides programmatic access to a running server process accessing the local data set.

:class:`metarelate.fuseki.FusekiServer` is a context manager, which handles the underlying Jena processes; it is always better to call this as a context manager, to enable this process handling to work effectively; so:

.. code-block:: python

    with metarelate.fuseki.FusekiServer() as fu_p:
        ## do something useful with fu_p
	## once this indented block is exited the process will exit cleanly

To retrieve a set of ordered translations, for example from a data set with formats 'um' and 'cf' defined, :meth:`metarelate.fuseki.FusekiServer.retrieve_mapping` can be used.

.. code-block:: python

    import metarelate.fuseki
    with metarelate.fuseki.FusekiServer() as fu_p:
        mappings = fu_p.retrieve_mappings('um', 'cf')


Application Programming Interface
----------------------------------

The API provides a Python interface to the knowledge base.  

To use the API, create an instance of the metarelate.fuseki.FusekiServer class, as detailed in the API documentation.

Examples
--------

There is more information in the `exporting translations <../exporting/index.html>`_ pages.

For examples of this approach, see how Iris makes use of metarelate and the metOcean-mapping translation information in `iris-code-generators <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-code-generators>`_




Contribution
============

The project aims to collate and manage translation information from many sources.  Contributions to the knowledge base are crucial.

To contribute:

  * Create a branch in your git repository, linked to the main data project your are interested in, and check it out.
  * Load the static data into your local triple store.
  * Use the editor application to add information to the knowledge base.
  * Validate your changes against the information rules in the application.
  * Persist your changes to your local static data store.
  * Propose these changes to the relevant Metarelate github data project as a Pull Request.
